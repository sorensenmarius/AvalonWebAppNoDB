# Avalon: The Resistance - Web App
Paired with [this API](https://github.com/sorensenmarius/AvalonApiNoDB), this web app let's you play Avalon: The Resistance from your couch. If you do not know the game you can read the rules [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/avalon/game-rules.php)

## Running the App
Running this app is pretty simple and only conatins a few steps. This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so if you are familiar with that, this should be a breeze. If not follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
3. Start the API

Yeah, that's it.

## Contributors
This project was made by me and my friend [Simon Degen](https://github.com/SimonDegen). We also created the entire game while using a boilerplate, but it didn't turn out to well, so we restarted the project from scratch. If you want to check out the old repositories they can be found [here](https://github.com/sorensenmarius/AvalonWebApp) and [here](https://github.com/sorensenmarius/AvalonApi). If we ever get around to learning Dart, [this](https://github.com/sorensenmarius/AvalonMobile) Flutter mobile app will probably be where it can be found. 

If you want to contribute, simply make a PR and we'll check it out ;)
